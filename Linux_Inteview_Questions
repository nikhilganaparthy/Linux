1. What do you mean by Linux? Explain its features?
  Linux is a Unix-like open-source computer operating system (OS) that directly manages hardware and resources of a system such as CPU, 
  memory, and storage, and manages the communication between software and hardware.It is freely distributable and is generally built around 
  Linux Kernel (low-level system software that is used to manage hardware resources for users). Furthermore, it can be installed in mobiles, 
  laptops, computers, notebooks, etc. Flavors of Linux OS include Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE Linux, Gentoo, etc.
    Some important features of Linux OS include: 
      -> Free and Open Source: It is freely and easily available to anyone.
      -> Robust and Adaptable: Linux can operate for prolonged periods without crashing and considered to have very much immune to security threats.
      -> More secure: It is more secure as it provides security using authentication features like password authentication, 
          security auditing, and file system access control.
      -> Multiprogramming System: More than one can function or an application can run simultaneously.
      -> Application Support: It has its own software repository i.e., place or storage location from where software can be retrieved 
          so that users can download and install applications.
      -> Supports customized keywords: There are many different languages used throughout the world, therefore Linux supports the 
          installation of multiple languages keyboards.
      -> GUI (Graphical User Interface): It provides an interface for users to interact with the system and allows to use of GUI 
          applications such as VLC, Firefox, etc.
